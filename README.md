## Programs Overview Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator

### This program calculates a student's grade based on their marks:

Input: A number between 0 and 100.
Output: Corresponding grade:
    A for marks > 79
    B for marks between 60 and 79
    C for marks between 50 and 59
    D for marks between 40 and 49
    E for marks below 40.

## Challenge 2: Speed Detector

### This program checks the speed of a vehicle and calculates demerit points:

Input: Speed of the vehicle (in km/h).
Output:
    Prints "Ok" if speed is <= 70.
    Prints the number of demerit points for speeds above 70, with 1 point for every 5 km/h over the limit.
    Suspends the driver's license if points > 12.
    \
Example: checkSpeed(80); // Output: "Points: 2" checkSpeed(130); // Output: "Points: 12" checkSpeed(140); // Output: "License suspended"

## Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator

### This program calculates an employee's net salary based on their basic salary and benefits:

Inputs:
    Basic Salary.
    Benefits.
Outputs:
    Gross Salary, Payee (Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Contributions, and Net Salary.
Example:

calculateNetSalary(50000, 10000); // Output: // Gross Salary: 60000 // PAYEE: 8200 // NHIF: 1300 // NSSF: 3600 // Net Salary: 46900

## Prerequisites

Node.js installed on your system.
A text editor or IDE (e.g., VSCode).

## Installation

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ladyhabz1/Code-challange-Week-1 
```
### Navigate to the project directory:

cd Code-challange-week-1

Run the scripts directly using Node.js:

challenge1.js
challenge2.js
challenge3.js
Usage

Open the respective script file (challenge1.js challenge2.js challenge3.js).

Modify the input values in the code or prompt the user to input values interactively.
Run the script to view the output.
Testing Manual Testing

Update the function calls in the script files with test cases provided in the comments.
Automated Testing

Use a testing framework like Jest to write unit tests for each function.
Sample Jest test:

test('Calculates correct grade', () => {
  expect(getStudentGrade(85)).toBe("A");
  expect(getStudentGrade(45)).toBe("D");
});
